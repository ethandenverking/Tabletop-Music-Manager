# Tabletop-Music-Manager
An audio management web app built using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the YouTube Player API

Tabletop Music Manager is a tool designed for Dungeon Masters to streamline audio management during tabletop sessions. TMM uses the YouTube API in order to stream audio from videos directly, allowing users to ignore the clunkiness of having tens of tabs open during your campaign. A Dungeon Master's first priority should be managing his players, not his music.

TMM was inspired by the online web app RPG Ambience which is a music management tool that is no longer being maintained. It used audio files in order to service its user, whilst TMM streams music and ambience from YouTube directly

This project and site was created for the dual purpose of both being a tool for Dungeon Masters, as well as a resume piece for its creator. Any feedback is welcome.
